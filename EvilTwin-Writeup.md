# Evil Twin AP — Raspberry Pi 4, Dual Adapter

> Network details in this writeup are genericized. This was performed against a personally owned router/device, with explicit authorization; no third-party network or device was targeted.

## Goal

Stand up a rogue AP cloning a personally owned network's SSID, confirm a personal test device associates with it instead of the legitimate AP, and observe client traffic hitting a Pi-controlled interface, to validate the AP-impersonation side of the 802.11 trust model (as opposed to the client-capture work done in the handshake writeup above).

## Hardware / Software

- Raspberry Pi 4, Kali Linux
- Two wifi adapters: onboard/primary (`wlan0`, reserved for SSH/management) and a secondary adapter (`wlan1`, used for the attack. specficially an Alfa AWUS036ACM Wifi Adapter)
- `airbase-ng` (aircrack-ng suite), `dnsmasq`, `tcpdump`
- Target: personally owned WPA2-PSK router's SSID (cloned, not attacked directly), 2.4GHz

## Setup

Interface separation confirmed first, since this attack reconfigures the attack adapter repeatedly and a single-adapter setup would risk severing the SSH session used to control the Pi:

```bash
ip a   # confirm wlan0 and wlan1 are separate physical adapters
       # note wlan0's subnet to avoid collision with the fake AP's subnet later
```

## Launching the rogue AP

```bash
sudo airmon-ng stop wlan1mon      # attack interface must NOT be in monitor mode for airbase-ng
sudo airbase-ng -e "<SSID>" -c <channel> wlan1
```

This creates a new virtual interface, `at0`, which carries the fake AP's data path. Left running in foreground for the duration of the test.

## Network configuration

```bash
sudo ifconfig at0 up
sudo ifconfig at0 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
```

Subnet chosen deliberately distinct from `wlan0`'s to avoid two interfaces on the Pi claiming overlapping local address space.

```bash
# dnsmasq.conf
interface=at0
dhcp-range=192.168.1.10,192.168.1.100,255.255.255.0,12h
```

```bash
sudo dnsmasq -C dnsmasq.conf -d
```

## Observation

```bash
tcpdump -i at0
```

## Result

Test device associated with the rogue AP without a deauth being necessary — the AP was broadcast open (no password), and association appears to have been driven by a combination of signal strength and the client device picking an available network matching a known SSID. Devices generally do not verify AP identity beyond SSID and security type, so there was nothing on the client side to distinguish the clone from the real AP.

`dnsmasq` logged a full DHCPDISCOVER → DHCPOFFER → DHCPACK sequence, confirming the client received a valid lease in the configured pool. `tcpdump` on `at0` showed outbound traffic from the client (DNS lookups, ARP requests, background app connectivity checks) consistent with a device that believes it has a working network connection.

`at0` had no onward route to the internet by design — all observed traffic terminated at the Pi rather than reaching its actual destination. This was a deliberate scope limit for this test, not a failure: the goal was confirming association and passive visibility, not full interception.

## What wasn't done

- No IP forwarding / NAT out through `wlan0` — client had no real internet access, so no payload data was ever actually transmitted to capture
- No captive portal or credential harvesting page
- No deauth used against the legitimate AP to force the client over; association happened without it

These represent the next logical steps if this is extended, not oversights in this test.

## Takeaways

- Client devices pick networks primarily on SSID + security type, not verified AP identity — this is a protocol-level gap, not something specific to any one router or device.
- An open (no-password) rogue AP will often win association over a legitimate password-protected one with no additional effort, particularly at close range — no deauth required in this test.
- A rogue AP with no forwarding configured is a legitimate and useful intermediate test state: it proves association and gives visibility into attempted connections without yet building out full interception.
- `tcpdump -i at0` is the right place to watch for live confirmation of a client landing on the fake AP — faster feedback than relying on the client device's own UI, which may not clearly indicate anything is wrong.
- Two separate wifi adapters are effectively required for this attack if a management/SSH session needs to stay alive on the same Pi — the attack interface gets reconfigured (monitor mode off, AP mode, new virtual interface) in ways that would otherwise kill the control connection.
